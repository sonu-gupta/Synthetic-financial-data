# Synthetic Financial Data Generation for Fraud Detection

I used the credit card fraud dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> (published by ULB).

About Dataset: It includes information on credit card transactions carried out by cardholders in Europe during September 2013. The data pertains to a two-day period and shows that out of 284,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent. The dataset is imbalanced as the fraud cases represent only 0.172% of all transactions.

The code is adapted from:

In progress: Evaluation of the quality of synthetic dataset.
